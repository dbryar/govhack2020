## Govhack 2020
# Ready. Aim. Fire.

The Garnaut Report noted that increasing extremes would have a visible impact on the frequency and intensity of bushfire by about 2020. How incredibly true that became over the Christmas of last year.

But who’s responsibility is fire safety? 

Well, on the driest inhabited continent on Earth, it is the responsibility of everyone who lives here.

From the most remote farm, to the most densely populated high-rise, citizens need to take responsibility for fire safety in their communities, as many already do. Especially those that stand to lose the most in the event of fire, hence why our rural fire services are manned by volunteers.

From our Local Government to our State and Federal Departments and Agencies, preparation for increased fire risk in changing climatic conditions should be a top priority. Sadly, ideology and party politics has managed to get in the way of making efficient and effective changes to climate change risks.

And for those that are able to assist in providing data or services to help authorities plan, prepare and respond to fire safety, there should be mechanisms for them to do so. Open data need not only be a one way street, and Citizen Science can play a part in supplying relevant air quality, soil moisture and rainfall data to assist in fire safety modelling, and fire emergency response.

But how do we as a society prepare for our warmer and drier future?

First, we need to trust the data, and the science. We need to remove or reduce human induced delay in our actions to reduce, remove or respond to fire risk. 

Current fire detection systems are limited to public observation and reporting. This is a low cost, low fidelity solution to a potentially catastrophic problem. Every minute of delay in reporting and responding to a bushfire results in a logarithmic escalation of the required time and resources required to bring the situation under control.

We also have human induced delay passing the report from the observer, to the dispatcher, firstly via the ‘Triple Zero’ service, to fire command, to the district officer, then finally to the closest available response crew. This takes on average more than one hour, and may take up to 3 or four hours in remote regions. By this stage, the fire is already burning out-of-control

A data driven system, given enough machine learning time and input, could despatch a helicopter within minutes, carrying a tonne of water that would douse the flame and nullify the situation in under 30 minutes, de-risking the situation before it gets out-of-control.

At present we use data models only to predict the likelihood of fire on any given day; we are all familiar with the words “Total Fire Ban”. But what do we know about the consequence of a fire starting? Likelihood and consequence need to be better related, and data can help with that too.

We have data available, both live and historic, on temperature , humidity, wind, rainfall, river levels, soil composition, soil moisture, vegetation/crop composition, vegetation/crop moisture, air purity, airborne particulate matter, and lastly, satellite and camera imagery.

Surely a data model armed with all this data could see a fire coming from a mile away??

We have smoke detectors in every house across the country that are very good at saving lives. Why don’t we have similar sensors in the bush? We have incredibly powerful computers that can deal with multiple inputs to create data models that indicate ‘fire in the air’, so why don’t we use them?

With more input, data models can be bolstered to make faster, and more accurate decisions with regards to;
Hazard reduction burns
Tree clearing decisions taking fire risk in to account
Identification of fire situations prior to emergency
Deployment of fire-fighting resources in a non-emergency situation

At present we have no method for citizen scientists to contribute data to these models yet there are plenty of people willing to share their air quality, temperature, humidity, wind and rainfall data, as evident in the thousands of cloud enabled and publicly available home weather monitoring and reporting systems.

The project conceived was to build a repository for citizen scientists to contribute telemetry data and imagery, and combine these with official records and live data to produce a model that could actually make the decisions necessary for fire preparedness, taking in to account the potential value of crop losses, animal losses, and not just human life when it comes to fire management.

Sadly, 54 hours is nowhere near enough to fully explore the data model, but we can look at existing non-government services like Fireball International’s FUEGO and see that there are much better systems for reporting than relying on direct observation.

While I would never condone the use of commercial video in such an event as Govhack, I would encourage those planning and preparing for fire safety to have a look at the commercial video Fireball have put together as it highlights many of the issues identified in this presentation.
